    <h2>ReactJS</h2>
    <p>
      React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components by Facebook Inc. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.

      MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License. MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.

    <h2>NodeJS</h2>
    <p>
      Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming. </p>
